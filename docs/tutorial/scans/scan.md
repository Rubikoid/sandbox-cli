!!! warning "Warning"

    This is an outdated option and not supported as well as others, it is recommended to use [Advanced scan](./scan-new.md).

    The documentation for the options can be viewed in the same section.

    It still remains because the old versions of the sandbox don't support the new API.

## Quick start

<!-- termynal -->

```sh
$ sandbox-cli scanner scan -t 120 malware
```
